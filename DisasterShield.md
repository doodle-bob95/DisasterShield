# DisasterShield
 ICT171 Assignment 2 

 Computer and security data is a critical field in today's society, and it is important for it to be protected and know how to save the data in times of emergency. This project, known as DisasterShield, aims to develop a disaster recovery and backup solution using DigitalOcean as an IAAS platform. This project ensures automated and secure backups to minimise as much data loss risks as possible and set up a downtime in case the system fails or undergoes a threat, such as a cyberattack or accidental deletion of data. This project will deploy a basic cloud server on DigitalOcean (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB SSD) running Ubuntu. The backup system will use DigitalOcean Spaces (100GB) as cloud storage for incremental and full backups. Key components include: an automated backup system, a disaster recovery mechanism, security and compliance, as well as cost efficiency. The system will benefit businesses and individuals needing affordable, reliable disaster recovery without requiring physical infrastructure. Compared to an SAAS backup system, this project will provide greater customization and flexibility.
